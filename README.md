# What is This?

This repo is about face recognition and triplet loss. I trained that model with TensorFlow 2.0 and I used Casia-WebFace as dataset.

# Explain Code!

Everythin about data is running by ```main_data_engine.py```. And everything about model training is ```main_model_engine.py```'s  job. I use ```face_recognition_tester.py``` for generating images above.


Models can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rxlgPE_JsfB707NC2Eih_6R_wIgAgssG).

Please contact me if you have a question, i will be honored to answer.
